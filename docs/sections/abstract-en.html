<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The role of the SIM4NEXUS ontology is to support the data and variables harmonization for the different models to be implemented at case-study level (thematic models and system dynamic models) as well as policy and game data. Indeed, the SIM4NEXUS ontology will permit the "Knowledge Elicitation Engine" (KEE) to analyse the inforamtion and to perform the policies recomendations to the game. Considering this aspects, main features of the ontology are: 
 1. A model to categorise and describe the variables of the nexus. 
 2. A model to represent the polici cards and objectives associated to a Game. 
 3. A model to represent the information related to the context of the game. </span>
